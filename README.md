So, something about myself, huh... 
I'm Ann-Britt, a woman from the Netherlands. I started coding not too long ago, mostly within bioinformatics. 
I only know a bit, Linux shell commands and Python. I like Python best so far, but might try to get a grip on other languages later.
Right now I'm writing a script in Python for an internship, it will probably show up on GitHub!
